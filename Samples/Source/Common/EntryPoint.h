Usage: Somewhere in the end of your Main file

// Declare application class, e.g:
using ApplicationClass = YourApplicationClassName;
#include "EntryPoint.h"

Your application class should have Initialize and Deinitialize methods. It can be empty if you want to leave
all your initialization code in the constructor.

class YourApplicationClassName : public Hk::GameApplication
{
public:
    YourApplicationClassName(ArgumentPack const& args) :
        Hk::GameApplication(args, "Your title")
    {}

    void Initialize()
    {
    }

    void Deinitialize()
    {
    }
};
